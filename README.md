This shiny app allows users to calculate the 100-year GWP of six common greenhouse gases (CO2, N2O, CH4, HFC-134a, CFC-11, and CF4), 
as well as the 20-year GWP of methane, using default global warming potential values from the IPCC Fifth Assessment. 
It's a nice graphical representation of just how much more potent methane, nitrous oxide, and CFCs are than CO2.
